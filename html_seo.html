<!--SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a practice that optimizes web pages so they 
become more visible and rank higher on search engines. One way to improve your site's 
SEO, is to provide a short description for the web page using the meta element. Here is 
an example of using the meta element to set a page description for a gardening site:--> 

<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>

<!--The open graph protocol enables you to control how your website's content appears 
across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more. By 
setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage with 
your content. You can set these properties through a collection of meta elements inside 
your HTML head section.

The first important OG property to include would be the title. Here is an example of 
setting the OG title for the freeCodeCamp homepage:-->

<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />

<!--For the property attribute, you will need to specify that it is og:title. The content 
attribute is where you will write the title you want displayed for social media sites.

The next important OG property would be the type. Here is an example of using the OG type 
for the freeCodeCamp homepage:-->

<meta property="og:type" content="website" />

<!--The type property is used to represent the type of content being shared on social 
media. Examples of this content include articles, websites, videos, or music.

The third important OG property would be the image. Here is an example of setting the OG 
image for the freeCodeCamp homepage:-->

<meta
  content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
  property="og:image"
/>

<!-- In this example, the open graph image is pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo. All of 
 these images should be high quality with good dimensions and ratios. Most social media 
 platforms will include criteria for image requirements to help you ensure that your 
 content displays well on their site. For example, the developers.facebook.com documentation 
 page states:

"use images that are at least 1200 by 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution 
devices. At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 by 315 pixels to display link 
page posts with larger images."

The fourth important OG property would be the url. Here is an example of setting the OG 
url for the freeCodeCamp homepage:-->

<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />

<!--There are many more OG properties that you can set, like description, audio, video 
and locale. However, the open graph url, image, type, and title are the most important 
ones to include.

So how do these open graph properties affect Search Engine Optimization? When your content 
is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance for your 
content in users' feeds. This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal to
 search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.-->
