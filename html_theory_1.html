<!--The div element is used as a container to group other elements.-->

<!--Here is an example of a div element. Add another paragraph element inside 
of the div element and see the changes in the preview window. -->

<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div element.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph inside the same div element.</p>
</div>

<!--You will mainly use the div element when you want to group HTML elements that 
will share a set of CSS styles.(more on this later)-->

<!--Even though the div element is commonly used in real world codebases, you 
should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be 
more appropriate.-->

<!--For example, if you wanted divide up your content into sections, then the 
section element would be more appropriate than a div element.-->

<!--Add another section element below the first one. Then inside of 
the section element, a h2 and p elements. You can use whatever text you like 
and you will see the changes in the preview window.-->

<section>
  <h2>Mammals</h2>
  <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live young.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lion</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Dolphin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Birds</h2>
  <p>Birds are warm-blooded animals with feathers and wings. Most can fly and lay eggs.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Eagle</li>
    <li>Parrot</li>
    <li>Penguin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<!--The section element has semantic meaning over the div element which is not 
semantic. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, 
which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means 
if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and 
understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it. -->

<!--The id attribute adds a unique identifier to an HTML element.
Here is an example of an h1 element with an id of title.
Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with an id set to "subtitle". 
You can write whatever text you like for the h2 and you will see the changes in 
the preview window.-->

<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
<h2 id="subtitle">Top 5 Movies of 2024</h2>

<!--You can reference the id name of title within your JavaScript or CSS. Here's a 
CSS example referencing the id of title to change the text color to red. 
NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for you in this interactive example. Don't worry 
about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn more about that in 
future lessons. But if you want to see the text color change to blue, click on the 
styles.css tab in the editor and change the color: red; to color: blue;.-->

<!--The hash symbol (#) in front of title, tells the computer you want to target an 
id with that value. id names should not be used more than once, and they should always 
be unique. Another thing to note about id values, is that they cannot have spaces in 
them. Here is an example of applying the words main and heading to an id attribute 
value:-->

<h1 id="main heading">Main heading</h1>

<!--Browsers will see this space as part of the id which will lead to unwanted issues
 when it comes to styling and scripting. id attribute values should only contain 
 letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.In contrast to the id attribute, the class
  attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces.Here is an 
  example of applying a class called box to a div element.-->

<div class="box"></div>

<!--If you wanted to add multiple class names to an element, you can do so by 
separating the names by a space. Here is an updated example applying multiple 
classes to a div element.-->

<div class="box red-box"></div>

<!--Here is an another example of applying multiple classes to multiple div elements.

NOTE: Some CSS has been provided for you in this interactive example. Don't worry 
about trying to understand the CSS code because you will learn more about that in 
future lessons. But if you wanted to change the color of the first and third boxes, 
click on the styles.css tab and change the background-color: red; to

  <!--An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent 
  a reserved character in HTML.

Let's say you wanted to display the text This is an <img/> element on the screen. 
If you use the code currently in the editor, it won't display the desired result. 
Even if you added src and alt attributes to the example, it would show an image in 
the middle of the paragraph. Not the desired result. -->

<p>This is an <img /> element</p>

<!-- When the HTML parser sees the less than (<) symbol followed by an HTML tag name, 
it interprets that as an HTML element. That is why you are not getting the desired 
result of This is an <img/> element on the screen.

To fix this issue, you can use HTML entities. Here is an updated example using the 
correct HTML entities for the less (<) than and greater than (>) symbols. Now you 
should see This is an <img/> element on the screen.

Try adding a &lt;p&gt;learning is fun&lt;/p&gt; below the paragraph element. You 
should see <p>learning is fun</p> on the screen.-->

<p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;learning is fun&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<!--These types of character references are known as named character references. 
Named references start with an ampersand sign (&) and end with a semicolon (;). 
By using a named character reference, the HTML parser will not confuse this with 
an actual HTML element.

Another type of character reference would be the decimal numeric reference. This 
character reference starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol (#), followed by 
one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon.

Here is an example of using the decimal numeric reference for the less than symbol.
Change the code in the editor to see different symbols. You can use &#169; 
for the copyright symbol and &#174; for the trademark symbol.-->

<p>This is an &#60;img /&#62; element</p>
<p>This is an &#169; symbol for copyright.</p>
<p>This is an &#174; symbol for trademark.</p>

<!--The last type of character reference would be the hexadecimal numeric reference. 
This character reference starts with an ampersand sign, hash symbol, and the letter 
x. Then it is followed by one or more ASCII hex digits and ends with a semicolon.

Here is an example of using the hexadecimal numeric reference for the less than 
symbol.

Change the code in the editor to see different symbols. You can use &#x20AC; for 
the euro symbol and &#x03A9; for the Greek capital letter Omega symbol.-->

<p>This is an &#x3C;img /&#x3E; element</p>
<p>This is an &#x20AC; symbol for euro.</p>
<p>This is an &#x03A9; symbol for Greek capital letter Omega.</p>

<!--The script element is used to embed executable code. Most developers will use this 
to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web 
pages. Common examples of using JavaScript include interactive games, image sliders,
 and dynamic forms that validate user input in real-time.

Here is an example of using the script element in an HTML document. Remove the // 
from in front of the alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp"); and you should see an alert 
pop up.-->

<body>
  <script>
     alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>

<!--While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, 
it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. 
Here is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript 
file:-->

<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>

<!--The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript 
file. src stands for "source". The reason why it is not encouraged to place all of 
your JavaScript inside the HTML document is because of separation of concerns. 
Separation of concerns is a design principle where you separate your programs into 
distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern. In this case, 
we want to separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code.-->
